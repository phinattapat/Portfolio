                    &emsp;&emsp; Hi! I'm Nattapat Nipatjakaranan, and I'm happy to tell you a little about myself. My different experiences have made me who I am today.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;I love coding, it's more than just a hobby; it's a passion that lets me explore creativity and solve problems using computers. Coding sparks my creativity and logical thinking. Besides coding, I enjoy reading, playing badminton and hiking, which keep me curious and connected to the world.
                    <br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;I'm friendly, curious, and always ready to chat. And I'm also empathetic, open-minded. These qualities help me understand others. I enjoy connecting with people and having good conversations. Whether it's about ideas or coding, I love sharing and learning from others.
